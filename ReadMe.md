The aim of this was to be able to send and recieve data over UART using a dsPIC30F4011 and the MPLAB X IDE for my Microcontroller Application Group Lab (MAGL) module at university.

The skills gained in from this project went on to be used to communicate sensor data between 2 dsPICs in a small robot built to complete in a micromouse-style challenge.
